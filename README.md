# hello_world
My first git code thing

What's up everybody
I am here to test out this whole github thing
as I am not familiar with it at all.


I am trying to get acquainted with GitHub. It is not easy teaching an old dog new tricks but I'm getting there. I started all this to learn about IBM's carbon design system.
